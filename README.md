# ZTM-Bootcamp-Projects
My personal rendition of the Zero To Master Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Bootcamp milestone projects.

Includes the Bulldozer Price Prediction project, following along with the directions presented in the course, as well as Stroke Prediction project that follows the general guide presented in the course. Additionally, I have included the environment.yml that contains the environment I used for this project.

**Note:** Because of the github file upload limit, I cannot upload the data (and some misc. files) for the bulldozer-price-prediction-project. Thus, until I set up Git LFS, please download the data directly from the link included in the notebook itself.

## Human Action Recognition Project

A project meant to take in images of humans and classify them into fifteen types of actions. Uses both ResNet50 fine-tuning and a CCT.
